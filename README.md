### Build CLI in one line
<sup>..or two</sup>
```golang
cli := quicli.Cli{
  Usage:       "SayToTheWorld [flags]",
  Description: "Say Hello... or not. I f you want to make the world aware of it you also could",
  Flags: quicli.Flags{
    {Name: "count", Default: 1, Description: "how many times I want to say it. Sometimes repetition is the key"},
    {Name: "say", Default: "hello", Description: "say something. If you are polite start with a greeting"},
    {Name: "world", Description: "announce it to the world"},
  },
}
cfg := cli.Parse()
```

With this code you obtain the following help message:
```
Say Hello... or not. I f you want to make the world aware of it you also could

Usage: SayToTheWorld [flags]

--count -c      how many times I want to say it. Sometimes repetition is the key. (default: 1)
--say   -s      say something. If you are polite start with a greeting. (default: "hello")
--world -w      announce it to the world. (default: false)

Use "./sayhello --help" for more information about the command
```

### Use flags value in code
```golang
cfg.GetIntFlag("count") // get the --count flag value
// or alternatively
cfg.GetIntFlag("c")
```

### Disclaimer
The library is a wrapper of the built-in go `flag` package. It should only be used to quickly built CLI and it is not intented for complex CLI usage.
